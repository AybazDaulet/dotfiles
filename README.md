# Structure

The top-level files represent your $HOME directory, and the .config directory represents your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

## Tools I use

- Alacritty as my terminal emulator because it's fast and stable.
- tmux as my terminal multiplexer because it gets the job done and is reliable. 
- Neovim since I'm too lazy to learn Emacs.

NvChad is a base of my nvim config.

## Requirements

- Hack Nerd Font
